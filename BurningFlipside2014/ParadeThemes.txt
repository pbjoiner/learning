Parade Lazzi:

Exorcise the Deamon MOOP
One runs ahead to drop some MOOP making a point to be noticed. The rest come upon the MOOP and hold an exorcism. 

Protest the MOOP
The parade carries signs similar to Westboro Baptist protesting the presence of MOOP.

Melodrama MOOP
One runs ahead to drop some MOOP making a point to be noticed. The rest com upon the MOOP and decry the presence of the MOOP with much wailing, weeping, beating of breasts, and tearing of hair. One of the assembled has a bright idea, he/she shall carry away the MOOP to make art with it. All rejoice. Exeunt with a flourish.

Deliberate MOOP
The group divides in two. The first leaves a trail of MOOP while the secod picks it up. When someone from the first group runs out of MOOP to drop, they join the second. Then someone from the second group takes their bag of MOOP and joins the first group dropping what they've picked up. 

Drum Parade
This is just an exercise in noise. We beat on drups and shake rattles and call to everyone to join us in our MOOP parade.
