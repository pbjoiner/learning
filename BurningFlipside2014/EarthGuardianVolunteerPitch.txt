What We're Not

The Earth Guardians are not a cleanup crew. Each burner is as responsible for their own experience and their own moop. Our job during the burn is to keep that thought in mind. We each create and maintain our own joy and catharsis. Similarly, we each create and maintain the physical place in which we reside.

Preaching

You can be just as much of a self-righteous ass as you like. Just be fun about it. My own ass is incredibly self-righteous. That's why I have a few choice friends play with it every once in a while to remind it what a joy life can be.

Trash is boring. Picking up is boring. Let's bring the joy of our burn to every part of our experience. Let's keep this fun.

The Earth Guardians have three roles:

Represent

At your own camp, remind yourself and others to pick up as you go along. It's just easier that trying to patrol everything while you have a hangover.

Parade

On each day of Flipside there will be two parades. These are meant to keep our anti-moop philosophy in mind as we celebrate our art and our selves.

Show Up

The big clean happens on the cleanup weekend after the burn. This is the part where we *do* become a cleanup crew. We can do it together and make it fun, active, and full of pickel backs.
