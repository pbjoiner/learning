Why I Leave No Trace

Honestly, I don't care much about the planet. The planet will not miss me when I am gone. I have no children and am not likely to. The thought of human extinction warms the cockles of my withered little heart. Really, I watch the news and cannot wait for global thermonuclear zombie apocalypse. But I take exception to poison in my water and air. I even take exception to being a poisoner.

When I poison my environment, I poison myself. So the whole idea of reducing my use of resources just makes sense. Anything I don't use doesn't create that much crap for me to breathe and drink.

I reuse my waste. No, not that kind of waste. Keeping feces around is just plain messy, disease-y, and deprives the world of dillo dirt. I reuse my paper waste. I do it because I am a cheap skate. 

Similarly, I use my junk mail for papier-mâché. It's free. It's easy. I like my life that way. It turns out that being a skin-flint bastard is good for the planet.

Our grandparents knew all this. OK, maybe your great grandparents, 'cuz I'm really old. They grew up during the First Great Depression. When the economy dives into a sewer, we learn to make do. We get more creative.  By my grandma's standards, I am an amateur. That woman could make a dime stretch for six years, bless her little banker's heart.

I drive a hybrid. While I do care about emissions (in my own lungs). I care more about the price of gas. Over the course of my little car's lifetime, I will save enough in gas costs to buy another car.

The sauces I buy at Ghandi Bazaar come in sturdy plastic tubs. These things will outlast the sun and they seal well enough to carry soup without leaking. These disposable items are eminently reusable. Why spend money on other plastic containers when these come with my favorite pickled ginger?

I am not a vegetarian. The entire planet's food cycle is based upon stabbing something cute and fuzzy and eating it while it's still alive and squealing in pain. If not that, then the poor thing is swallowed whole and drowns in stomach acid. Rather than follow the example of a preying mantis, I pack a vegetarian lunch because it's cheaper than meat, lowers my cholesterol (anything to make Doc stop bitching) and it keeps longer. As I plan my meals for next Flip, I'm thinking about what will keep longest unrefrigerated or taste good after freezing solid. Sure, on Friday I'll be eating something cute and fuzzy that once nuzzled its young with human-like affection. Sunday, I'm looking forward the the best dal this side of Mumbai on a bed of red rice. It's cheap, it keeps, and it's yummy.

The less I need to insulate, the less I need to carry to the site, the less I'm likely to leave behind.

Foam coolers are cheap and easily damaged. I hate them. Nevertheless, I own one. If I cover it with a layer of duct tape then it will last longer and I won't have to buy another one. Better still, next time I need one, I'll get something that will last longer. It will cost more in the short term but will last longer than a dozen foam coolers.

I do it because I am selfish. I like my living space free of detritus. I do it because I don't actually leave no trace. I leave less than I used to and more than I will next time.
