Why We Leave No Trace

Each year we gather at Burning Flipside to express and excess ourselves. Each year we diligently strive to leave the land in better condition than we found it. But why do we take such effort? Why is the simple act of picking up after ourselves so sacred?

In the spirit of reasoned debate, I have gathered three facts to enrich our Flipside experience. Here, then, is why we leave no trace:

1. Cleaning Is Passive-Aggressive

When I was young, Mother would express her displeasure in a wide variety of ways. The quietest was by cleaning at us. She would demonstrate how much she deserved "a better family" by pointing out all the little bits of the house we failed to bring to perfection.

We can do that too.

2. God Hates Moop

In an unexpected turn of faith, the Westboro Baptist Church has shifted its laser-like focus away from homosexuality to litter. They were last seen picketing the funeral of an incinerator manager bearing signs that read "Thank God for Global Warming!" and "Plastic Bottles Burn In Hell!"

3. Fuck the Planet

She is a murderous ball of hate. She loves nothing better than to kill us with volcanoes, oceans, predators, microbes, and whatever hideous means we can devise for ourselves. She would be greatly amused if we choked ourselves on our own filth. Let's disappoint the sullen bitch.

In light of these few items of purest logic, let us return with renewed vigor to our efforts to leave no trace.
