Join the Celebration of the Earth Guardians

The burn is a celebration. Every part should be so, even the MOOPing. Let's bring the joy of our burn to every part of our experience. Let's keep this fun.

Parade

On each day of Flipside there will be two parades. These are meant to keep our anti-MOOP philosophy in mind as we celebrate our art and our selves. Parade participants must be willing to PERFORM! Parades should be loud, bright, and entertaining. Be prepared to improvise comedy, sing, dance, and raise a burning rukkus.

Represent

At your own camp, remind yourself and others to pick up as you go along. It's just easier that trying to patrol everything on Monday morning while packing. While representing, remember the words of the Great Prophet Wheaton, "Don't be a dick."

What We're Not

The Earth Guardians are not a cleanup crew. Each burner is as responsible for their own experience and their own MOOP. Our job during the burn is to keep that thought in mind. We each create and maintain our own joy and catharsis. Similarly, we each create and maintain the physical place in which we reside.

The Earth Guardians are performance art with a message. Let's spread the message of Leave No Trace with joy, compassion, and creativity.
